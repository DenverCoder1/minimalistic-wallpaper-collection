# Minimalistic Wallpaper Collection

This is my collection of minimalistic, flat art, and colorful, digital nature wallpapers.

**Disclaimer:** None of these wallpapers were designed by me. Most of these wallpapers were found on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/) or the artists' DeviantArt or portfolio site.

## API

The website also includes a random wallpaper API, so you can request random wallpapers from the collection using a web request.

To use the API, simply make a request to:

```md
https://minimalistic-wallpaper.herokuapp.com/?random
```

To get multiple random images at once, it is recommended to change the URL slightly to avoid caching. For example,

```md
https://minimalistic-wallpaper.herokuapp.com/?random=1
https://minimalistic-wallpaper.herokuapp.com/?random=2
https://minimalistic-wallpaper.herokuapp.com/?random=3
```

This API can be used for setting daily wallpapers on a mobile device by combining it with an app such as IFTTT.
